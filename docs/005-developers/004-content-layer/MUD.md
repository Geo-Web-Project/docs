# MUD

[MUD](https://mud.dev/) is an onchain framework for building ambitious onchain applications. Along with fundamental infrastructural improvements to ETH/L2s, it makes keeping the entire state of the Geo Web content layer in the EVM technically and financially feasible. 

Both the content associated with [PCO land parcels](../../concepts/digital-land-registry) and the upcoming AR Commons will be defined with [MUD Worlds](../geospatial-publishing/mud-world). This approach will improve composability, reduce network dependencies, strengthen permissionless access, and provide a powerful new [way to develop applications on the Geo Web](../geospatial-publishing/augments). 

The Geo Web's MUD-based content layer is targeted for launch after the March 2024 Dencun ETH mainnet upgrade.
