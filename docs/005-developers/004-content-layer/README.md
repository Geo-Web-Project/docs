  The Geo Web is envisioned as a peer-to-peer network. The current
  implementation uses IPFS and Ceramic to link, publish, and retrieve content.

# Content Layer

The core protocols of the internet and web were designed to enable peer-to-peer (p2p) communication, but client-server architectures still dominate today. Many of the biggest issues of Web 2.0 (winner-take-all economics, the attention economy, and censorship) can be traced back to the dynamics created by this architecture. For the Geo Web to fulfill its promise as a permissionless, egalitarian network, its full stack must be and remain decentralized.

While the security and data availability guarantees offered by Ethereum smart contracts are necessary for the Geo Web’s digital land market operations, the Geo Web’s content layer calls for a different set of tools. The Geo Web needs dynamic, efficient, but still decentralized content linking, transmission, and storage. The user experience offered must match or exceed the convenience and cost effectiveness offered by Web 2.0 architectures.

We're still in the early days of web3, but we're well on our way to delivering on this goal with a content layer consisting of [IPFS](./ipfs), [Ceramic](./ceramic), and [Filecoin](./storage).
