# Quick Start Requirements

## Mainnet

1. An Ethereum wallet
   - If you don't already have a wallet, [consider creating one with Coinbase Smart Wallet](https://wallet.coinbase.com/smart-wallet). This wallet uses passkey technology, so it doesn't require third-party app installs, passwords, or seed phrases.
   - Security Tip: You could also consider investing in and using a hardware wallet!
   - Privacy Tip: Consider using a fresh address for any land claims associated with your place of residence.
2. Connect your wallet to the Optimism network (not required with Coinbase Smart Wallet)
   - [Add it to your wallet via Chainlist.org (ChainID = 10)](https://chainlist.org/?search=Optimism)
3. At least 0.002 ETH per parcel to cover transaction payments & gas
   - Each parcel registration is a fixed 0.001 ETHx + [an annual PCO Network Fee stream](../concepts/partial-common-ownership)
   - You can bridge ETH to Optimism via the [official bridge](https://app.optimism.io/bridge/deposit) (or [one of several 3rd parties](https://www.optimism.io/apps/bridges))
   - You can also [send ETH to your address on Optimism directly sent from several centralized exchanges](https://help.optimism.io/hc/en-us/articles/10800854161563-Centralized-exchanges-that-support-Optimism)
4. Navigate to the [**Geo Web Cadastre**](https://geoweb.land/) with a modern browser and [begin transacting](./claim)!
