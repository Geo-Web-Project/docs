# Parcel Monitoring & Notifications

The Geo Web's [partial common ownership](../concepts/partial-common-ownership.md) land market gives licensors 7 days to respond to incoming bids. To help avoid missing the response window after a rival bid (or any other parcel activity), we strongly suggest setting up notification emails for all the parcels in your portfolio.&#x20;

The [Cadastre](https://geoweb.land/) now includes a simple feature & instructions to set up [Optimistic Etherscan](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/)'s _Watch List_ functionality to monitor all of your Geo Web parcels:

:::caution
An Optimistic Etherscan account is required to use this functionality. If you don't have one yet, you can sign up for one here: [https://optimistic.etherscan.io/register](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/register).&#x20;

Use an email that you regularly monitor!
:::

1. Navigate to the Geo Web parcel that you want to monitor.
2. Click the **Notification Add** icon in the parcel panel header.

3. Follow the onscreen instructions to add the parcel's [BeaconDiamond](../developers/core-contracts/beacondiamond/) contract address to your Optimisitic Etherscan _Watch List_.

:::tip
The Superfluid [Dashboard](https://app.superfluid.finance/) & [Console](https://console.superfluid.finance/) are other great tools to track and visualize your Geo Web parcels + streams.&#x20;

**Warning:** Don't manually cancel your streams on the Superfluid Dashboard or your parcels will go into foreclosure!&#x20;
