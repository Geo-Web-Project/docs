# Geo Web DAO

The Geo Web DAO \(decentralized autonomous organization\) is an entity established to help support transparent governance of the Geo Web network. The first iteration is an [Aragon DAO](https://aragon.org/) on the xDAI network found here: [https://aragon.1hive.org/\#/geoweb/](https://aragon.1hive.org/#/geoweb/).

The DAO is established as a Membership DAO with each member receiving a non-transferrable ERC-20 token that entitles the holder to one vote in all matters proposed within the DAO.

Current members can invite additional members to join the DAO by proposing a token distribution vote. Additional members will be invited and evaluated on the basis of demonstrated interest, contributions, and alignment with the Geo Webâ€™s mission.

Initially, the DAO will be used for binding on-chain and signal voting related to financial matters of the network. The DAO will vote on matters such as [SourceCred distributions](sourcecred.md), creation of open bounties, and contributor stipends funded through grants \(like [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/grants/1403/the-geo-web)\) and [network funds](../concepts/network-funds.md).

The DAO may eventually evolve into the entity \(or entities\) responsible for end-to-end stewardship of the project's funds, technology, and other assets. The DAO/project founders \(for transparency: [Cody Hatfield](https://twitter.com/codynhat) and [Graven Prest](https://twitter.com/GravenPrest)\) are committed to an exit-to-community strategy, but what optimal final form\(s\) that takes remains to be seen.
