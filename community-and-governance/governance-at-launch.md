# Governance at Launch

**Last Update: November 29, 2022**

The Geo Web project will be progressively decentralized.

At launch, the Geo Web smart contracts and treasury funds will be stewarded by a 3/4 Safe multi-sig. The Safe is on the Optimism network and can be viewed here: (Safe address added soon).

The initial signing group consists of two founding project contributors:

* Cody Hatfield
* Graven Prest

Each signer has committed to the following statement of responsibility:

{% hint style="success" %}
As a Geo Web Safe signer, I affirm the statements and commit to fulfilling the responsibilities that follow to the best of my abilities:

1. I have no personal claim on the assets or code controlled by the Geo Web Safe, but instead am serving in this role as a representative of the public’s interest.&#x20;
2. I will evaluate and vote on proposed transactions based on their impact on the “good of the public” which may include difficult trade-offs.&#x20;
3. I will only allocate network funds toward public goods and/or credibly neutral incentive mechanisms that aim to promote positive-sum outcomes.&#x20;
4. I will promptly engage with emergency transaction proposals should they arise such as when end-user assets or treasury funds are at risk.&#x20;
5. I will engage with vetted treasury proposals and planned enhancements to the core contracts, so as to not create undue delays.&#x20;
6. I will take industry-expected steps to maintain the security and sole control of my signing wallet(s).&#x20;
7. I agree to have my wallet address(es) and name listed publicly for transparency.&#x20;
8. I will inform my fellow Safe signers if I develop a conflict of interest or if I believe that I can no longer serve in the role effectively, so that a replacement signer may take my place.&#x20;
9. I acknowledge that this role is temporary. I may be removed by my fellow signers at any time for violations of this agreement or any other reason.&#x20;
10. I will push to progressively decentralize the project and minimize the scope of signers’ responsibilities.
{% endhint %}

In time, other web3 community members who share the Geo Web's values (who may or may not be actively working on the project) will be added to the multi-sig to further distribute responsibility. Ultimately, the multi-sig itself should be replaced with vetted alternative mechanisms.
