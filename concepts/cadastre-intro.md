# Cadastre

A _cadastre_ is a register of property showing the extent, value, and ownership of land.

The [Geo Web Cadastre](https://geoweb.land/) is the graphical user interface that serves that role for the Geo Web network. It can be thought of something like a combination of a domain name registrar (e.g. GoDaddy) and a content management system (e.g. WordPress). It integrates with the network's core infrastructure to make Geo Web land administration and content publishing accessible to non-technical users.

The Cadastre allows users to claim, transfer, and manage digital land parcels via a global map view. It integrates with popular Web3 wallet providers, so that users can manage their assets and transact without creating a "Geo Web account." [Transactions](land-transaction-types.md) include changing a parcel `For Sale Price`, claiming new parcels, and placing/responding to parcel bids.

The Cadastre currently offers basic publishing functionality. Landholders can name/rename their parcels. They can link web content via URI (http://, https://, ipfs://, & ipns://) to their parcels. They can also anchor digital content (image, audio, video, and 3D objects) to a structured media gallery. When Geo Web users visit the land parcel in the real world with [Spatial Browser](spatial-browsing.md), they discover this published content.

The Geo Web Cadastre is not intended to be the exclusive interface for interacting with the [Digital Land Registry](digital-land-registry.md), just the first. A portion of [network funds](network-funds.md) generated by the [partial common ownership system](partial-common-ownership.md) will be allocated to market development of better, differentiated registration and content management offerings.
