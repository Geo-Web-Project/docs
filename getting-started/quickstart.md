### Testnet

Below are the requirements to begin buying land and publishing on the Geo Web testnet today:

* Install and set up a wallet in the latest version of the [**MetaMask**](https://metamask.io/download.html) browser extension
* Navigate to the [**Geo Web Testnet Cadastre**](https://testnet.geoweb.land/)****
* Switch to the **Optimism Goerli Network** in your MetaMask extension&#x20;
  * If you don't see Optimism Goerli in your network list, you can add it to your wallet [via ChainList (ChainID = 420)](https://chainlist.org/?testnets=true\&search=Optimism+Goerli).
* Click the **Connect Wallet** button on the Cadastre and then click **Sign** after reviewing the transaction&#x20;
  * The Cadastre implements the [_Sign-In With Ethereum_ standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4361). The wallet address that you connect via MetaMask will serve as your "Geo Web account" for transacting in the land market.
* Zoom in, pan, or search for a location on Earth that you'd like to control on the Geo Web.
* Single-click on an **unclaimed coordinate** on the map to [begin your first transaction](../concepts/land-transaction-types.md)
  * Define your desired parcel shape and single-click again to lock it in
* If you don't have any OP Goerli ETH, click the [_Request testnet ETH_](https://optimismfaucet.xyz/) __ link found in the three dots menu in the header.
* Complete and submit the required **land parcel fields in the transaction panel**&#x20;
* Sign the triggered **MetaMask transaction**
* After your transaction is confirmed on the network, the Cadastre will refresh to **display your new Geo Web land parcel.**
