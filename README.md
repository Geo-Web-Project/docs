# Welcome

The Geo Web is a public good augmented reality metaverse. 

Publishers anchor digital content \(image, video, audio, or 3D objects\) to physical land using the Geo Web's open, ownerless protocols. Users engage with the content in the world with their smartphones, smartwatches, and smartglasses.

You can visualize the Geo Web as a persistent virtual layer covering Earth which users experience alongside the physical world. It is divided up into digital land parcels with a [system of property rights](concepts/partial-common-ownership.md) designed to encourage productive utility, public goods funding, and egalitarian opportunity. 

The Geo Web project is open source. The resulting network is controlled by its community rather than by a private, for-profit entity. 

The founding of the Geo Web is inspired by the open and democratizing nature of the early World Wide Web. The World Wide Web of 2021 \(i.e. Web 2.0\) is dominated by centralized powers \(Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, etc.\) that all too often abuse their monopoly positions, suppress innovation, and sell users' attention. 

We believe we can that we can start to change this dynamic with blockchain technology and carefully crafted [mechanism design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_design). The Geo Web is part of the Web 3.0 movement that aims to put users in control of their own data and the value generated by shared networks/protocols. 

The next era of computing is always-on and always-connected. "Being on the internet" will be a continuous state rather than a discrete action with the adoption of smart glasses, smart watches, and embedded computers. The Geo Web can become the "World Wide Web for Physical World" in this era. It can support healthier relationships with our technology, permissionless economic opportunities, and yet untold creative endeavors.

We hope that you'll join us on this journey as a user, contributor, educator, publisher, and/or creator. On this site, you'll find both technical and conceptual material to guide you through the rabbit hole to a better future on the internet.
