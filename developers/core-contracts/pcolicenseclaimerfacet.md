# PCOLicenseClaimerFacet

## Summary

The `PCOLicenseClaimerFacet` is the action facet that implements the claiming of new Geo Web Land parcels. This includes both the [Fair Launch ](../../concepts/fair-launch.md)and ongoing claim types.

Claiming a parcel requires setting a `For Sale Price`, opening the required Network Fee stream, collecting a stream buffer, defining the Coordinate path, and paying a one-time claim payment (during the Fair Launch period).&#x20;
